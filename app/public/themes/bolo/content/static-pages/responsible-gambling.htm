<p><strong>Social Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>
	<br>At BOLO BET, we are dedicated to promoting responsible gambling, we are aware of the seriousness of the social, emotional and financial impact that gaming may have on some players. We are keen to ensure that as our valued customer you enjoy your gaming activity in a socially responsible manner To this end, we provide you with the options of self-exclusion as outlined below.
	<br>
	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>How does self-exclusion help me?</strong>
	<br>Self-exclusion enables customers to take a break from gambling with BOLO BET and seek support with various help organisations such as gamcare (www.gamcare.org.uk). We have provided below, the names of such organisations for your easy reference.
	<br><strong><br></strong></p>

<p><strong>How do I self- exclude from your service?</strong>
	<br>You can request your first self-exclusion by contacting our customer support team or your agent.</p>

<p>
	<br>All customers can self-exclude for an initial minimum period of 6 months (and for an initial maximum period of 5 years), after which you can extend it further. You can request for your account to be self- excluded by contacting our customer support team or your agent. Once your initial self-exclusion period expires, you are able to extend it further for a minimum of 6 months up to 5 years. You can request an extension to your self-exclusion period by contacting our customer support team.</p>

<p>
	<br>During the self-exclusion period, your self–exclusion agreement cannot be revoked under any circumstance and you would not be permitted to use your account.</p>

<p>
	<br>Once the request for a self-exclusion is received, we will ensure any remaining funds are returned back to you and all account(s) you hold with us are subsequently closed as per your request. Any bets placed prior to self-exclusion will be voided.</p>

<p>
	<br>We endeavor to implement your request as soon as practically possible, however, please note that this process takes a reasonable working period to implement. We make every attempt to ensure any new account(s) which you may attempt to open while excluded are not opened or if opened are closed down immediately. If you find that you are still able to access any of our services despite all of the above, it is your responsibility to contact us immediately to inform us. BOLO BET will not be held liable to you or any third party if you are able to continue to gamble via any of our products or services or you continue to gamble on any third party’s website or premises.
	<br>For your own safety and ensuring a full control on your gambling activity, BOLO BET recommends that you self-exclude from any other gambling and betting activities you participate in either remote or land based.
	<br>

<p>
	<br><strong>Will my account be reinstated automatically after the expiry of the self-exclusion?</strong>
	<br>No, your account will remain self-excluded until you contact our customer services team or agent and specifically request for your account to be reinstated.</p>

<p>
	<br>Where if such request is accepted by us, a minimum of 24 hours cooling off period will apply before your account is reinstated.
	<br>We will not under any circumstances re-instate your account during an exclusion period.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Underage gamblers:</strong>
	<br>We will close any account that we deem to be operated by a customer under the age of 18 years. We take underage gambling very seriously and will carry out age verification checks on all registered customers, checks may be conducted in an electronic way or in some cases you will be required to provide proof of identification. It is illegal for a person under the age of 18 years to engage in gambling activities.

	<br>We are here to help.
