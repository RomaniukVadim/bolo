<p dir="ltr">Matchbook are fully licensed and regulated in Alderney. They are a contender against to the more common Betfair and Betdaq platforms.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">They have a low commission rate of 1% but can be tricky to work out as it differs for winning and losing bets. &nbsp;They offer great Asian Handicap markets and unlike the traditional Asian sportsbooks, they are very competitive on 1×2 markets and on all major outright betting. &nbsp;Matchbook’s US Sports offerings are also very good, certainly comparable to Pinnacle Sports.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Matchbook do not limit or restrict accounts and they welcome arbitrage players. &nbsp;Most interestingly, they offer a 24/7 VIP Skype betting service, which is easy to use and punters quite often get better terms (higher stakes or betting odds) by going through their VIP desk. &nbsp;Minimum stakes apply.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unlike Betfair, Matchbook do not have a ‘Premium Charge’ on winning bets.</p>
