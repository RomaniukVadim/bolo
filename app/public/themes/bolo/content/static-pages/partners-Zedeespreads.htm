<p dir="ltr"><strong>ABOUT <a href="http://zd8881.com/#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ZEDEE SPREADS</a></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Zedee Spreads is the new way of betting. By combining the excitement of buying and selling options on financial markets and exhilarating sports events, this uses your sports knowledge to boost profits. With more markets and more variety, your winning predictions have far better value in sports spreads compared to fixed odds betting. Buy and sell on markets such as Supremacy, Total Goals / Points, Corners, Bookings and many more. Available in various languages and devices.
	<br>
	<br>In fixed odds betting, you are betting on particular outcome - it is a simple win, lose or push. Whereas in sports spread betting, it’s not fixed and is very fluid throughout an event.
	<br>
	<br>There’s always a higher and lower figure that’s what is called, ‘the spread’. Zedee Spreads make predictions, then it’s up to you to decide if the final outcome will be higher or lower, more or less, faster or slower. If you think their price is too low, you would BUY (higher figure). If you think their quote is too high, you would SELL (lower figure).
	<br>
	<br><strong>For example: </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Fixed Odds Overs vs Spreads Total Goals market:
	<br>Selection: Everton vs Bournemouth
	<br>Final Score: 6-3
	<br>Make-up: 9 (6+3)
	<br>
	<br>If you had staked 100 with SBO on Over 2.75 @ 2.06, you would have won:
	<br>
	<br>Stake 100 over 2.75 @ 2.06 = 100 x 1.06 = 106 PROFIT
	<br>
	<br>But, if you had staked the same 100 with Zedee Spreads on BUY @ 3.00, you would have won:
	<br>
	<br>Stake 100 Buy Price Total Goals @ 3.00 = 100 x (9 make-up - 3.00) = 600 PROFIT
	<br>
	<br>Sports spread betting relies more than just the outcome, but your payout is dependant on how right you are or how wrong you are - and your stake size. It’s a very exciting opportunity to boost your profits if you have good sports knowledge.
	<br>
	<br>Customers enjoy sports spread betting because they have more options. In sports spread betting you can “close a bet” (stop the bet before the end of an event) to lock in profits / limit losses. Also, you can “flip a bet” (wager more to close the original bet and be left with an open bet on the opposite selection) if your opinion changes while the event is in-running.
	<br>
	<br>Supremacy and Total Goals are 2 of the most popular markets offered by all sports spread betting firms. Zedee Spreads have decided to try and take the markets further and introduce a series of mini Supremacy and Total Goals markets. You can bet on Supremacy and Total Goals in 15 minute periods throughout a match. You can also bet on 1st Half or 2nd Half Supremacy and Total Goals.
	<br>
	<br>Zedee Spreads also wanted to bridge the gap between sports spread betting and fixed odds betting by introducing a range of 0-100 Index markets, which work on a similar basis to traditional fixed odds bets, but incorporate the buying and selling nature of spreads. These new markets are known as "Fixed Odds Spreads". It’s a great introduction to sports spread betting for mainstream sportsbook players.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Here’s an example:</strong>
	<br>Zedee Spreads offers a 0-100 Home Team Index. This means if the home team wins they receive 100 points, if they fail to win they score 0 points - the market win or lose, 100 or 0.
	<br>
	<br>Selection: Manchester United vs Manchester City
	<br>Market: 0-100 Index (Home)
	<br>Spread: 40 (Sell price) - 44 (Buy price)
	<br>Bet: Buy @ 44
	<br>Result: United wins 2-1 = 100 make-up
	<br>
	<br><strong>Bet Calculation:</strong>
	<br>
	<br>100 (make-up) -44 (buy price) = 56
	<br>56 x 100 (stake) = 5600 PROFIT!
