</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: How long does a deposit take to be credited into my account?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong></span>Deposits are generally credited into your account immediately. Once a deposit is confirmed, you will see the amount in your balance on the BOLO BET site - displayed at the top, next to your username.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Q: I just made a deposit, but I do not see it in my BOLO BET balance...</strong></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span>Once a deposit is completed successfully, you will see this in your BOLO BET balance, displayed at the top, next to your username.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">We will &nbsp;follow your instructions and transfer your funds to the requested account(s). You will then see the funds in that specified account(s). During operating hours and upon your deposit being successful, we aim to complete requests within 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Please note - when funds are moved into your requested account(s) - your balance on the BOLO BET website will decrease.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">For example, you have zero funds in your BOLO BET account. You deposit 1,000.00 and instruct us to transfer this to your Orbit Exchange account. Your balance on BOLO BET will show 1,000.00 and then 0.00 once funds are transferred to Orbit.&nbsp;</p>
